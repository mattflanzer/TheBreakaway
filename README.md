As best as I could from memory of the problem.

Will not handle bad input very gracefully and assumes a few rules regarding team names:
1. A team name will not begin with a number
2. A team name will not contain a , (comma)
3. Team name matching is case and whitespace sensitive; ie: "LA Dodgers" does not match "La Dodgers" nor "LA  Dodgers"
